# Hello World 🌎 - I'm Cynthia Lim! 

I used to say that I'm "always learning". It served as a personal motto to remind me that any experience can be a learning opportunity. I recently realized that this is only part of the equation. 

*kaizen* is the Japanese term for <ins>continuous improvement</ins> and better captures what I truly want to prioritize. 

Here's how I'm implementing that in all aspects my life:

### 🌱 Learning, exploring, and building
<!-- - multi AI agent workflows with [crewAI](https://www.crewai.com/)
- full-stack development with a carpool project
- Blender and Unreal Engine for game development -->
- product management
- mobile app development and consumer apps

### 🏃‍♀️🏋️‍♀️ Hybrid Training
- off-season rowing training
- improving my 10k time

### 📚 Reading: The untethered soul
